# **Welcome**

Welcome to the Bitcoin Meetups Resources page! This is intended to host as many resources as possible for bitcoin meetup organizers around the world.

Running a bitcoin meetup can be a daunting undertaking and in many ways it is a big commitment. But building a community of local bitcoiners may be one of the most important and impactful things that you can do to advance bitcoin adoption and strengthen Bitcoin's most important security layer: the social consensus layer

Bitcoin is an open-source project and can be changed by anyone at any time. But, the bitcoin network runs on a social consensus of people who all agree what the rules of bitcoin are. As bitcoin continues to run, there will be future proposals for soft forks and hard forks and it is imperative that we have an active and educated social layer of bitcoiners who run the nodes and contribute economically to bitcoin by participating in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Bitcoin meetups are where we can continue to foster the development and education of new bitcoiners by offering a physical space for people to come together and share ideas, ask questions and learn from each other. A place where everyone has a voice and will be responded to directly without hate, spam or shadow bans. They are a place to build a community around, a truely local web of trust.

I hope that this page finds you well and offers you some tools that will help you start or continue your local bitcoin meetup.

Thank you for all that you do to advance bitcoin grassroots adoption!

# **Why Start or Continue a Bitcoin Meetup**

In many ways falling down the bitcoin rabbit hole can be a lonely path, especially when so many people you have tried to talk to about it so often dismiss it for any number of reasons. Sure, there are many opportunities to interact with friends and strangers on the internet, but real life interactions hit different in so many ways. Connecting with other bitcoiners IRL allows for immediate, deep conversations that skip superficial small talk, diving into shared beliefs about bitcoin, but also other so many other topics that we have all found on our path to find the truth, the signal through the noise.

Bitcoin meetups are a place where all of your friends are, even if you have never met them before. Bitcoiners are some of the most principled, devoted, and intellectually intelligent people I have ever met. Starting a bitcoin meetup is your opportunity to bring together all of the stranded bitcoiners in your area and to make each other stronger, smarter and more informed than we all are separately.

Beyond the softer, social reasons to run a bitcoin meetup, there are tangible benefits to connecting in real life that are impossible or extraordinarily complicated online.

- Local markets to exchange goods for sats
- Finding or fostering local businesses to accept sats for goods and services
- Bitcoin celebrations (halvings, pizza day, white paper day, genesis day, etc.)
- Hands on demos or workshops
- Meeting or connecting with developers or other industry leaders and experts

Ultimately, Bitcoin meetups are where we can continue to foster the development and education of new bitcoiners by offering a physical space for people to come together and share ideas, ask questions and learn from each other. It is also our opportunity to strengthen Bitcoin's most important security layer: the social consensus layer

Bitcoin is an open-source project and can be changed by anyone at any time. But, the bitcoin network runs on a social consensus of people who all agree what the rules of bitcoin are. As bitcoin continues to run, there will be future proposals for soft forks and hard forks and it is imperative that we have an active and educated social consensus layer of bitcoiners who run the nodes and economically contribute to the bitcoin base layer. Bitcoin meetups are a powerful tool for strengthening bitcoin's social consensus.

## **What are you Committing to as a Bitcoin Meetup Organizer**

Running a bitcoin meetup can be a daunting undertaking and in many ways it is a big commitment. But fortunately, if you are the organizer of your local meetup you are in control of how much you are committing to.

Running a bitcoin meetup can be as easy as posting a date, time and location of where you will be hanging out anyway! In that case your only real commitment is to show up! For meetup organizers just showing up, especially when you can do it consistently, gets you a good portion of the benefit of hosting your meetup!

The best advice for bitcoin meetup organizers is to pick a day/time that works for you and to show up at that time consistently at whatever frequency you can fit into your life. Most meetups meet monthly, but some meet more or less frequently, depending on the meetup organizer and what level of commitment they feel comfortable with. Also, once you get some regulars, see if you can recruit a co-organizer; this will decentralize your group a bit and help ensure the meetup outlasts its initial creator, but it also just makes it easier to fit running a meetup into general life. 

As you start to give yourself more responsibility as a community leader, you will find what works for you, but it is important to remember why you are running the meetup, so keep your mission in mind as you continue on your meetup journey.

## **Disclaimers and Risks**

Unlike meeting others online, meeting in real life can come with real life risks that should not be underestimated or underappreciated. Unlike bitcoin, which is a non-physical asset that can be protected with nuclear grade security in the form of strong encryption, YOU _are_ a physical asset and you should always be aware of the risks that come with operating in the real world.

Do not take this warning as a guarantee that if you start a bitcoin meetup that you will be attacked or physically assaulted in some way. Physical attacks in bitcoin are real, however, the vast majority of bitcoin physical attacks occur when people know that you will be carrying large quantities of money on your person and generally occur when you are alone or isolated in some way.

Here are some operational security good practices for bitcoin meetup organizers

- Do not use your full first and last name
- Do not post or otherwise share your home address with anyone you don't know or trust
- Do not bring large quantities of bitcoin or cash to a meetup
  - Do not keep large quantities of bitcoin on mobile wallets that you have on your phone
  - If you have access to a well endowed lightning node on your phone, set daily or weekly transfer limits
  - Do not keep bitcoin on an exchange that you can access from your phone or set withdraw limits or white-listed addresses
- Consider adopting a geographically distributed multisig setup for your bitcoin cold storage
- Pay attention. If you notice someone watching people arrive or leave take additional precautions, warn others, or change the way you list or advertise your meetup
- If you start a telegram or signal group, be aware of scammers and impersonators who will join the group and try to get people to send them bitcoin
  - It can be a good practice not to share your telegram link publically... just share it in person when new people join.

Operating in the real world always comes with real world risks and bitcoiners are not the only group that is susceptible to these types of risks. Opsec is important for everyone, but remember that as a bitcoin meetup organizer you are advertising yourself to the world as a leader of a group focused on the best performing financial asset in history.

Taking on more responsibility and accountability can be extremely rewarding, but almost always comes with additional risk.

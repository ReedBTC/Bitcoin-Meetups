# **How to Start a Bitcoin Meetup**

Starting a bitcoin meetup can be as easy as posting a date, time and location of where you will be hanging out anyway! And honestly, this is probably the best way to start out.

If you are just starting out, my recommendation would be to find a public social setting like a bar, coffee shop, library, or any other space that will allow people to meet up just to talk. As the meetup organizer, you should pick a time and location that work for you, but obviously times that work better for others are most likely outside of normal working hours and at locations that people are likely to be familiar with.

Once you start to get a group of people together you can all talk amongst yourselves about what make sense of how people would like to see the meetup grow and develop. If other people have requests for alternate times or locations, just remember that as the organizer it is up to you to continue to show up as consistently as possible, so you also have to be ok with whatever is requested. Other people are always welcome to start another meetup or offer to help organize your meetup on alternate days as long as they are going to also be committed to it.

## **Where to List your Bitcoin Meetup**

There are many places to post your bitcoin meetup and each of them will come with their own level of visibility. Some are free, others require a paid membership to list, some are more locally focused and all of them come with various tradeoffs.

Big picture, its actually kind of a pain to post your meetup in a bunch of different locations, so don't feel obligated to post in all of these places.

Here are some recommendations for where to post your meetup events:

- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)
- [Club Orange](https://www.cluborange.org/)
- [Evento](https://evento.so/)
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
- [Luma](https://luma.com/)
- [Satlantis](https://www.satlantis.io/)
- Your Meetup's Website
- [Twitter (X)](https://x.com/)
- Nostr (e.g., [Primal](https://primal.net/home), [Damus](https://damus.io/))

Many bitcoin meetups also start their own Telegram or Signal groups where they will also send out reminders and notifications of new events or to communicate side events or other fun things that other people in the group want to get the word out about. Personally, I have found that sometimes people may be reluctant to download and/or enable notifications on ANOTHER app, so I also started to collect email addresses so I can send out reminders that way and more people (especially older members) are more likely to see it.

## **How to Advertise your Bitcoin Meetup**

Most meetups do not advertise outside of simply posting them to any number of the sites listed in the section above; advertising is optional. However, if you are trying to get the word out about your meetup to try and gather up some more regular attendees here are some ideas of how to advertise your meetup.

- Post flyers where you host your meetup or in the surrounding area (old school)
- A box of business cards is actually quite cheap ~\$20 and you can put a QR code on them that links to your website, social media, meetup page or similar where they will be able to find where you post your upcoming meetups
- Start a social media account for your meetup and post announcements, reminders and photos or other media from past events
- There are several bitcoin podcasts that will read out boosts from podcasting 2.0 apps such as fountain or during live streams
  - [Local Bitcoiners](https://fountain.fm/show/Q48WBr6nT3mrbwMZ8ydY)
  - [Bitcoin And…](https://www.fountain.fm/show/eK5XaSb3UaLRavU3lYrI)
  - [Rabbit Hole Recap](https://www.fountain.fm/show/VDaMppQRUBZioj2XkaLn) 

At the end of the day, most meetup hosts will most likely agree that word of mouth is by far the biggest way that new members join. So, remind your meetup group to invite their friends, family and coworkers to attend, and make sure that your meetup is friendly and welcoming to newcomers, regardless of where they are on their bitcoin rabbit hole adventure.

## **How to Find a Venue for your Meetup**

### **_Social Meetups_**

As discussed in the section on how to start a bitcoin meetup, finding a location for a social meetup, where it is just a group of people who come to hang out and talk about whatever is on their mind, finding a venue is pretty easy. Just find a public social setting like a bar, coffee shop, library, or any other space that will allow people to meet up just to talk. 

As your meetup grows, you might find that some of these spaces get too crowded for your meetup to be inclusive and function properly, so you might look for a place that has a back or side room that you can either reserve or that is often not crowded that you can just kind of take over during your meetup. If you want a location that accepts bitcoin, check out [BTC Maps](https://btcmap.org/) to see if there is a potential venue in your area that accepts bitcoin. 

### **_Educational Meetups_**

Finding a venue for an educational or Socratic Seminar style meetup can be much more challenging. Often you will be looking for a venue with a TV or projector that you can use to share content, watch videos or a space that is conducive to interviews or other talks / speeches. Finding these venues, outside of working hours at low or no cost can be a challenge.

Libraries are great, but you'll need to make sure that the space is equipped for your needs and can handle the number of people you expect. You will also often need to provide your contact information and indicate that your meetup is open to the public.

If you have meetup members who own local businesses or know people who own local businesses, sometimes they will donate a space for your meetup.

If all else fails, you can normally find a venue that will be willing to rent you a space, however, this may not be sustainable for smaller meetups. If you are interested in this option, see if you can get your meetup members to donate to your meetup before renting the space. Also, see the section on [bitcoin meetup financial support](support.md#financial-support).

## 💡 Community Tips

*Submitted by meetup organizers — [add yours via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ReedBTC/Bitcoin-Meetups/issues/new)*

- Provide some food for your attendees - this goes a long way. It'll get more people to show up, and those who show up will really appreciate the gesture. Some will often pitch in paying for the bill as well if you want to accept their generosity. 
- Stay consistent and meet at least once every two months. Attendance tends to follow market sentiment — more people show up near all-time highs — but even at bear market bottoms people will still show up. 
- Don't put too much stock in RSVP numbers. Sometimes you'll have very few RSVPs and a big crowd shows up, other times you'll have a lot of RSVPs and very few people walk through the door. Plan for variance.
- Be welcoming to everyone who shows up, even if they're shitcoiners. They will show up, especially when the price is way up. Be respectful, but let them know that this is a bitcoin-only meetup, but offer them some basic education about why we are bitcoin only and why we don't waste people's time on other cryptos. 
- Visit other local meetups yourself. Get to know the other hosts, build a relationship with them, and once you have some rapport it's usually appropriate to mention your own meetup. It's a two-way street.
- When writing your meetup listing, be descriptive in the title and make it clear in the description that all experience levels are welcome. A lot of people are intimidated by the technical side of bitcoin, so explicitly calling out that it's a casual meetup for networking and learning will help them feel comfortable enough to show up.
- On Club Orange, take advantage of the ability to find and DM people located near you. Let them know you run local meetups. You'll almost always get a reply asking when the next one is — then you can send them the link!
- Give out swag. Stickers are cheap and easy — brand your meetup with a cool name and logo and print them up. Also keep an eye out for companies in the bitcoin space that offer goodies for meetup hosts; free magazines, trading cards, and other items have all been available at various times. People really appreciate a freebie.
- Build a relationship with your venue. When you're ready to host more formal events, having an established relationship with the restaurant or venue can get you a good deal on a function room — or sometimes even the space for free.

# **How to Build a Meetup Website**

If you are looking to add some legitimacy to your meetup you might consider launching a meetup website.

If you're looking for a budget website you can host a simple HTML website on GitHub. This is not as hard as it sounds… my advice would be to read the how to guide and use an AI to walk you through the process if you are new to GitHub or if you have never had a website before.

- Here is a guide of how to host a website on GitHub
  - [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- Here is a meetup site repo you can fork
  - [BitDevsNYC](https://github.com/BitDevsNYC/BitDevsNYC.github.io)

There are also services who will build you a website; however, these are services you will need to pay for and vary significantly in price and quality. You can ask around on social media and will likely find other bitcoiners who would be willing to make you a website, but again, most will be looking for you to pay for their service. [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) is another option for finding resources who can build you a website on a budget. Consider working with AI to find a good option for you.

Another option is to get a good domain name and simply forward it to your preferred event listing page such as your meetup.com page. If you want to save on a domain, you could even get a free URL shortener like bitly or tinyurl which will take your meetup.com link and connect it to something like bit.ly/yourmeetupname, which might be a little easier to share than the full meetup.com url.

# **Get Support for your Bitcoin Meetup**

## **Community Support**

Bitcoin meetups are decentralized, which is good for independent content development, but not so good for coordination and support. Fortunately, there are several telegram groups you can join if you are a meetup organizer to get feedback on ideas, or to get support from the community of bitcoin meetup organizers

Reach out to me on telegram (@ReedBTC) and I will do my best to get you invited to these telegram groups if you run a meetup.

### **_Grassroots Bitcoin_**

Bitcoin Park hosts an annual event at bitcoin park in Nashville for bitcoin meetup organizers that is invite-only. This is a great opportunity to meet other meetup organizers to talk about lessons learned, feedback and to get and share ideas.

If you are currently running a bitcoin meetup the best way to get an invite to grassroots is to join their telegram channel and look out for the invite there.

### **_Grassroots Quarterly Roundtable_**

Grassroots Quarterly is a quarterly virtual meeting for bitcoin meetup organizers that started in July 2025 and was largely an outgrowth of the Grassroots 2025 meetup at Bitcoin Park in Nashville. It is an open forum for bitcoin meetup organizers to talk about challenges, share ideas, and collaborate to help each other improve and streamline their bitcoin meetup preparation and execution. Look out for the invites in the telegram groups mentioned above if you'd like to join our calls.

## **Financial Support**

Be prepared to spend more bitcoin than you bring in if you are a bitcoin meetup organizer… there are definitely ways to minimize cost, but ultimately, if you are a passionate leader, you will end up spending sats to get a meetup.com organizer account, make business cards, get an AI subscription, buy pizza or beer, rent a hall for a party or any number of other things you could do to make your meetup all that you hoped it would be.

By far the easiest way to get financial support for your meetup is to ask your members to donate! The Bitcoin and open-source development community relies on the concept of [value-4-value](https://value4value.info/). For those of you on nostr, you know that people like to send sats to content they get value from and your meetup is likely providing more value to your members than a silly meme or vlog post on nostr. Let your members know the cost of the meetup and ask them to contribute if you are planning a larger event.

### **_External Financial Support_**

External financial support for bitcoin meetups is thin at best. Occasionally companies in the bitcoin space may offer support, but this is generally for their local meetups or comes with strings attached like sharing referral links or similar to actually get financial benefits.

If you provide free and open-source content and/or come up with other interesting ways to spread bitcoin education or outreach through your bitcoin meetup, you could apply for an [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/) grant. Note that your project MUST HAVE a proper open-source license & educational materials must be available to the public under an open license in order to [apply](https://opensats.org/apply).

### **_Starting a Non-Profit_**

If you are serious about trying to bring in money, you could start a 501(c)(3) non-profit which would provide tax advantages to donors to your meetup. Note, however, that it can be difficult to find donors willing to contribute enough to offset the application costs and the additional accounting burden.

See [form1023.org](https://www.form1023.org/) for help and instructions for setting up a non-profit.

## 💡 Community Tips

*Submitted by meetup organizers — [add yours via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ReedBTC/Bitcoin-Meetups/issues/new)*

- Give out swag. Stickers are cheap and easy — brand your meetup with a cool name and logo and print them up. Also keep an eye out for companies in the bitcoin space that offer goodies for meetup hosts; free magazines, trading cards, and other items have all been available at various times. People really appreciate a freebie.
- Build a relationship with your venue early. When you're ready to host more formal events, having an established relationship with the restaurant or venue can get you a good deal on a function room — or sometimes even the space for free.
